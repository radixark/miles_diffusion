title: Rewards
description: Built-in reward models (PickScore, HPS, OCR), rm_hub dispatch, and prompt data format.
---
Miles-diffusion scores generated images (or video frames) after each rollout
microgroup. Reward computation lives in `miles/rollout/rm_hub/` and is invoked
from `sglang_diffusion_rollout.generate_and_rm_microgroup`.

For `--custom-rm-path`, `--custom-reward-post-process-path`, and other
`--*-path` hooks, see [Customization](customization.md).

## 1. At a glance

| Stage | Flag | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Reward type | `--rm-type` | Selects built-in scorer (`pickscore`, `hps`, `ocr`); ignored when `--custom-rm-path` is set |
| Per-sample override | `metadata.rm_type` in JSONL | Overrides global `--rm-type` |
| Custom reward / norm | see [Customization](customization.md) | `--custom-rm-path`, `--custom-reward-post-process-path` |

## 2. Built-in reward models

### PickScore (`--rm-type pickscore`)

Implementation: `miles/rollout/rm_hub/pickscore.py`.

PickScore scores text–image alignment using a CLIP model pair:

- Processor: `--pickscore-processor-path` (e.g.
  `laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K`)
- Model: `--pickscore-model-path` (e.g. `yuvalkirstain/PickScore_v1`)

Scoring formula:

```
score = exp(logit_scale) * dot(text_emb, image_emb) / 26.0
```

The `/ 26.0` scaling maps raw PickScore logits (~0–26) to roughly 0–1.

PickScore runs as a **Ray actor pool** (`PickScoreRewardActor`) with round-robin
batching. For video outputs, frames are uniformly sampled
(`--pickscore-num-frames`) and scores are averaged.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--pickscore-num-workers` | 1 | Ray actor count |
| `--pickscore-num-gpus-per-worker` | 1.0 | GPU per worker (non-colocate) |
| `--pickscore-batch-size` | 8 | Batch size per actor |
| `--pickscore-processor-path` | — | Required for pickscore |
| `--pickscore-model-path` | — | Required for pickscore |
| `--pickscore-num-frames` | None | Video frame sampling count |
| `--pickscore-reward-colocate` | False | One worker per rollout GPU (requires `--colocate`) |

Example from `scripts/run_diffusion_nft_sd3_pickscore.py`:

```bash
--rm-type pickscore \
--pickscore-num-workers 1 \
--pickscore-num-gpus-per-worker 1.0 \
--pickscore-batch-size 8 \
--pickscore-processor-path laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K \
--pickscore-model-path yuvalkirstain/PickScore_v1
```

### HPS (`--rm-type hps`)

Implementation: `miles/rollout/rm_hub/hps.py`.

HPSv2 scores text–image alignment using a preference-tuned CLIP model:

- Model: `ViT-H-14`
- Version: `--hps-version` (`v2.0` or `v2.1`)
- Checkpoint: `--hps-checkpoint-path` (optional; defaults to `xswu/HPSv2`)

Scoring formula:

```
score = diagonal(image_features @ text_features.T)
```

The diagonal pairs each image with its corresponding prompt in the batch.

HPS runs as a **Ray actor pool** (`HPSRewardActor`) with round-robin batching.
It currently accepts image outputs only (`generated_output` with one frame).
Use a custom RM when defining video frame aggregation semantics.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--hps-num-workers` | 1 | Ray actor count |
| `--hps-num-gpus-per-worker` | 1.0 | GPU per worker (non-colocate) |
| `--hps-batch-size` | 8 | Batch size per actor |
| `--hps-version` | `v2.1` | `v2.0` or `v2.1` checkpoint |
| `--hps-checkpoint-path` | None | Local checkpoint; unset downloads from `xswu/HPSv2` |
| `--hps-reward-colocate` | False | One worker per rollout GPU (requires `--colocate`) |

Example from `scripts/run_diffusion_grpo_sd3_hps_sglang.py`:

```bash
--rm-type hps \
--hps-num-workers 1 \
--hps-batch-size 8 \
--hps-version v2.1 \
--hps-reward-colocate
```

### Reward placement

Every GPU reward pool is placed one of two ways:

- `--<rm>-reward-colocate`: every worker takes one **slot** on a rollout placement-group bundle,
  sharing that GPU with the train actor and the rollout engine. Colocated pools share one slot ledger, so `hps` and `pickscore` can both colocate without
  overlapping; more workers than bundles is rejected at parse time. Requires `--colocate`.
- Otherwise the pool is **standalone**: default-scheduled at `--<rm>-num-gpus-per-worker`,
  which only lands on GPUs outside every placement group (placement groups reserve their
  GPUs, so Ray never packs these onto rollout GPUs).

`RolloutManager` seats the colocated pools before the first rollout; standalone pools are
built on first use.

### Combining rewards

`--custom-rm-path` receives `(args, samples)` and can call the built-in scorers
directly; `--custom-rm-args` is an opaque string the framework hands to that function
through `args`, so the function owns its own config grammar. The shipped example
`miles/rollout/rm_hub/weighted_mixture_rm.py` reads `name=weight,name=weight`:

```bash
--custom-rm-path miles.rollout.rm_hub.weighted_mixture_rm.weighted_mixture_rm \
--custom-rm-args "hps=0.7,pickscore=0.3" --reward-key weighted \
--pickscore-processor-path laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K \
--pickscore-model-path yuvalkirstain/PickScore_v1 \
--hps-reward-colocate --pickscore-reward-colocate   # each reward keeps its own placement flags
```

The example returns a dict per sample (`{"hps": ..., "pickscore": ..., "weighted": ...}`).
`--reward-key` picks the entry GRPO trains on, and every entry of a dict reward gets its own
`rollout/reward/<name>_mean` panel, so the components stay visible while the sum is optimized.

Weights apply to raw scores (HPSv2.1 ≈ 0.25–0.35, PickScore/26 ≈ 0.8–0.9, OCR ∈ [0, 1]), so
pick them with the scales in mind. Colocated pools share one slot ledger, so several rewards
can colocate without overlapping. Rewards receive `generated_output` itself, and every reward actor
quantises it to uint8 on its own terms.

#### Validated mixture: SD3.5 OCR 0.8 + PickScore 0.2

The OCR recipe with PickScore mixed in, the weighting Stepwise-Flow-GRPO (arXiv 2603.28718) uses
for its OCR task. Only the reward flags change; everything else is
`scripts/run_diffusion_grpo_sd3_ocr_sglang.py` as shipped (2×H200, colocated, CFG 4.5,
`--diffusion-kl-beta 0.04`, 8 prompts × 16 samples per rollout):

```bash
python3 scripts/run_diffusion_grpo_sd3_ocr_sglang.py --cuda-visible-devices 0,1 --extra-args "\
  --custom-rm-path miles.rollout.rm_hub.weighted_mixture_rm.weighted_mixture_rm \
  --custom-rm-args ocr=0.8,pickscore=0.2 --reward-key weighted \
  --pickscore-num-workers 1 --pickscore-batch-size 8 --pickscore-reward-colocate \
  --pickscore-processor-path laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K \
  --pickscore-model-path yuvalkirstain/PickScore_v1 \
  --rollout-shuffle"
```

600 rollouts (110 s each); means over the last 100 rollouts, 10-rollout moving-average peak in
parentheses:

| Component | Rollout 0 | Last 100 | Peak |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ocr_mean` | 0.34 | 0.80 | 0.88 |
| `pickscore_mean` | 0.80 | 0.83 | 0.85 |
| `weighted_mean` | 0.43 | 0.81 | 0.87 |

OCR climbs while PickScore holds. `--rollout-shuffle` softens the per-rollout dips that a small
prompt batch (8 per rollout here) otherwise produces.

### OCR (`--rm-type ocr`)

Implementation: `miles/rollout/rm_hub/ocr.py`.

OCR reward compares PaddleOCR output against target text embedded in the
prompt. The target is the string between the first pair of double quotes.
Simplified scoring:

```python
target = prompt.split('"')[1]
reward = 1 - levenshtein_distance(recognized, target) / len(target)
```

The implementation also lowercases both sides, strips spaces, treats a
substring hit as perfect (`dist=0`), and caps `dist` at `len(target)` — see
`miles/rollout/rm_hub/ocr.py`.

OCR runs on **CPU** Ray actors (`--ocr-num-workers`, default 4). Used by the
SD3 Flow-GRPO recipe (`scripts/run_diffusion_grpo_sd3_ocr_sglang.py`).

### Remote RM (`--rm-type remote_rm`)

The CLI exposes `--rm-url` for a remote reward service, but **`rm_hub` does not
implement `remote_rm` today** — selecting it raises `NotImplementedError`.
Use `--custom-rm-path` to call an external service instead (see below).

## 3. Call chain

```
generate_and_rm_microgroup()
  → batched_async_rm(args, microgroup)          # rm_hub/__init__.py
    → custom_rm_path?  user batched function
    → all pickscore?   pickscore_rm (batched)
    → all hps?         hps_rm (batched)
    → all ocr?         ocr_rm (batched, one image per actor call)
    → else             per-sample async_rm → ocr / pickscore / hps / NotImplementedError
  → sample.reward = score
  → RolloutManager._post_process_rewards()      # GRPO advantage normalization
```

After rollout, `RolloutManager._post_process_rewards` subtracts the mean and
optionally divides by std to produce normalized advantages for training.
Override that path with `--custom-reward-post-process-path` — see
[Customization](customization.md) § Reward.

## 4. Prompt data

### JSONL format

Training prompts are loaded from `.jsonl` files via `miles/utils/diffusion_data.py` and read in
file order; `--rollout-shuffle` permutes them once per epoch (seeded by `--rollout-seed`):

```json
{"input": "A photo of a cat wearing sunglasses"}
{"input": "A logo saying \"Miles\"", "metadata": {"rm_type": "ocr"}}
```

| Field | CLI mapping | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt text | `--input-key input` | Required non-empty string |
| Per-sample metadata | `--metadata-key metadata` | Optional dict; supports `rm_type` override |

### Dataset subsets

Dataset repo: [`rockdu/miles-diffusion-datasets`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rockdu/miles-diffusion-datasets)

| Subset | Used by |
|---|---|
| `hpdv2/` | SD3 HPS Flow-GRPO |
| `flowgrpo_pickscore/` | PickScore recipes (SD3 NFT, Qwen-Image, Wan2.2, LTX) |
| `flowgrpo_ocr/` | SD3 OCR Flow-GRPO, NFT smoke test |

### Per-sample rm_type override

JSONL `metadata.rm_type` overrides the global `--rm-type` for that sample:

```python
# rm_hub/__init__.py
metadata.get("rm_type") or args.rm_type
```

Mixed rm_types within one microgroup fall back to per-sample dispatch (no
batched PickScore/HPS fast path).
