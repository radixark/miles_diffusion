Miles-diffusion is a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework for **diffusion models** — text-to-image and
text-to-video. It couples [sglang-diffusion](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) for high-throughput rollout with
**FSDP2 + diffusers** for training, and inherits the modular, minimal-core design of
[Miles](https://github.com/radixark/miles).

*"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single rollout."* — For DiT models the rollout is a full denoising
trajectory, and miles-diffusion focuses on the system work that makes trajectory-level RL stable, efficient, and
reproducible.

## Core features

- **Fast and stable support for the latest diffusion models.** Launch-ready recipes for Wan2.2-T2V-A14B, Qwen-Image,
  LTX-2.3, the Cosmos3 MoT omni family, and SD3.5. A per-family `TrainPipelineConfig` isolates model quirks so new
  architectures plug in without touching the trainer.
- **LoRA training with ipc-handle weight sync.** PEFT LoRA on the FSDP2 actor; each iteration ships only
  `lora_A`/`lora_B` pairs to the rollout engines over CUDA IPC and merges them engine-side — no full-weight transfer, no
  separate merge or conversion step. See [LoRA Training and Weight Sync](/advanced/lora).
- **Quality control on three fronts.** Deterministic mode makes runs bitwise reproducible and backs the CI e2e
  regression suite; sglang-side monkey patches manage train/rollout alignment; and an FSDP2 param-dtype patch manages
  precision — by providing per-parameter level fp32 precision control over FSDP2 under the mixed-precision policy. See
  [Deterministic Training](/advanced/deterministic) and [Dtype Control](/advanced/dtype-control).
- **SFT, DiffusionNFT, and Flow-GRPO under one trainer.** The loss type, training-batch preparation, rollout function,
  and reward function are all **replaceable components**, so integrating a new algorithm — or swapping in your own
  customized component — is easy.
- **Sglang native.** Rollout runs **on the inference engine itself** — the sglang-diffusion serving stack — with RL
  support and optimizations living engine-side, and **train–inference consistency** is managed through a curated set of
  monkey patches that pin engine kernels to the numerics of the training-side diffusers forward to achieve maximized
  match.
- **Multiple parallelisms.** The rollout engines scale with **tensor and sequence parallelism** to support large models
  and very long contexts; training scales with **USP (Ulysses × Ring)**, built from each family's diffusers `_cp_plan` —
  or a self-written one — for agile model integration.



## Supported models

Each model name links to its recipe page. Every documented recipe is labeled with a
[recipe verification level](/user-guide/recipe-verification).
